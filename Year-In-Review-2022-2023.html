            Let me begin by highlighting one of the standout moments of the year – my participation in the MakeUC Hackathon. Joined by a team of four exceptionally talented individuals, we embarked on a remarkable project that would make a lasting impact. Our endeavor involved the development of a virtual library utilizing Unity Game Developer and C#. The objective was to make educational books, which were previously inaccessible to the citizens of the United States, available to the public. Through this captivating journey, not only did I acquire invaluable knowledge in game development, but I also discovered a newfound fascination with various subjects explored within these books. It was an immensely gratifying experience to create something that had the potential to enhance knowledge and make a positive impact on the lives of others.
