                    Hey there, I am Kartavya Singh. I am a Junior (3rd Year) student at the University Of Cincinnati pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am also enrolled in the Accelerated Engineering Degree (ACCEND) Program pursuing my Master of Engineering in Computer Science. I was born in India and lived most of my childhood in India, before relocating to Kuwait where I spent 8 years of my life.<br><br>My name 'Kartavya' is a Hindi word, which when translated to English means 'Responsibility' and/or 'Duty'. I believe that my name has a significant impact on what I am as a person in this world, as it always makes me remember my sole purpose of living, which is to fulfill all my responsibilities while keeping everyone around me and myself happy. I was brought into this world on the 17th of October 2003.<br><br>Even since I have taken a step into the world, my life has been a series of events. I was born and spent my entire childhood in India, making friends, playing around, exploring woods, and doing anything crazy & risky has always been something I am into. The biggest fear and sense of losing everyone came to me when my dad had a transfer to Kuwait due to his profession.  I felt devastated; the sense of leaving everything behind and having a fresh start hit me hard.<br><br>My life in Kuwait was filled with many twists and turns from learning a language completely unknown to me to making new friends and fitting into a society completely different from mine felt very different, yet fascinating. It took me some time to adapt to these sudden changes in my environment.<br><br>Within a few years, I graduated from high school, and moved to the United States of America, to pursue my higher education at the University of Cincinnati. My life took new traction toward writing my destiny. As adaptability has been a part of my life, I began habituating myself to my new surroundings. This new venture felt like a new face of adulting. From working on my academics to participating in several organizations, events, and hackathons. I continued to add a piece to this puzzle every day.<br><br>As I progress toward a new tomorrow, I will continue to add more flavors to my life that would lead to my personal, professional, and academic development.
