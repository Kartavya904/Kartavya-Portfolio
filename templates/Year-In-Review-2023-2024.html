            FaunaFinder is a captivating web application that serves as a gateway to the enchanting world of wildlife. Whether you've captured a mesmerizing image of an animal in the wild or simply have the name of an animal in mind, our platform brings you closer to nature's most wondrous creatures. Using Google Cloud Vision, Python, Flask, and a host of other technologies, we built a platform that not only identifies animals but also provides comprehensive information about them via Wikipedia integration and similar species through the GBIF API. Users can also explore the world of random animals, adding an element of surprise and education to the mix. Throughout the development process, we encountered several challenges, such as ensuring accurate animal recognition from user-uploaded images and handling cases where the API's results included breeds and subcategories. We also faced complexities in gathering and presenting comprehensive information about animals from multiple sources. Overcoming these challenges required extensive problem-solving and fine-tuning of our application. Despite these hurdles, we achieved a high degree of precision and enriched the user experience with educational surprises. Our efforts were recognized with the Best Use of AI in Education award, a testament to our innovative approach and technical expertise.

            In addition to my hackathon successes, I had the distinct honor of becoming the Director of Values at the National Residence Hall Honorary (NRHH). This role allowed me to engage with a diverse group of eager students and lead numerous service and recognition projects. As Director of Values, I was deeply involved in organizing events that fostered a sense of community and appreciation within the residential halls. One notable event was the team recognition for the RED Staff, who ensure the wellbeing of residence hall students, and another for the CAPS (Counsel of Psychological Services), who support student mental health. These events highlighted the critical roles these teams play in maintaining a supportive and inclusive environment for students. Additionally, our service project involved creating and donating 300 bookmarks to the local public library, fostering a sense of community and giving back. This project was particularly rewarding as it brought together volunteers who were passionate about making a difference. These experiences have deepened my appreciation for service and leadership, and I look forward to continuing my contributions in the upcoming semester. The opportunity to lead and work with such dedicated individuals has been incredibly fulfilling, and I am excited to see what the future holds for the NRHH.
